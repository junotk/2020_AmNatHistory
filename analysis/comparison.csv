0,0,Experimental Hybridization Studies Suggest That Pleiotropic Alleles Commonly Underlie Adaptive Divergence between Natural Populations,"The alleles used for adaptation can pleiotropically affect traits under stabilizing selection. The fixation of alleles with deleterious pleiotropic side effects causes compensatory alleles to be favored by selection. Such compensatory alleles might segregate in interpopulation hybrids, resulting in segregation variance for traits where parents have indistinguishable phenotypes. If adaptation typically involves pleiotropy and compensation, then the segregation variance for traits under stabilizing selection is expected to increase with the magnitude of adaptive phenotypic divergence between parents. This prediction has not been tested empirically, and I gathered data from experimental hybridization studies to evaluate it. I found that pairs of parents that are more phenotypically divergent beget hybrids with more segregation variance in traits for which the parents are statistically indistinguishable. This result suggests that adaptive divergence between pairs of natural populations proceeds via pleiotropy and compensation and that deleterious transgressive segregation variance accumulates systematically as populations diverge.",1810,"Selection, Epistasis, and Parent-of-Origin Effects on Deleterious Mutations across Environments in Drosophila melanogaster","Understanding the nature of selection against deleterious alleles is central to determining how populations are affected by the constant influx of new mutations. Important progress has been made in estimating basic attributes of the distribution of selection coefficients and gene interaction effects (epistasis). Although most aspects of selection are likely to be context dependent, little is known about the effect of stress on selection and epistasis at the level of individual genes, especially in multicellular organisms. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we measure how selection on 20 mutant alleles is affected by direct and indirect genetic factors across two environments. We find that environmental stress increases selection against individual mutations but reduces selection against combinations of mutations (i.e., epistasis becomes more positive). In addition, we find a high incidence of indirect genetic effects whereby the strength of selection against the alleles carried by offspring is dependent on the genotypes of their parents."
1,1,The Ecology of Individual Differences Empirically Applied to Space-Use and Movement Tactics,"Movement provides a link between individual behavioral ecology and the spatial and temporal variation in an individual's landscape. Individual variation in movement traits is an important axis of animal personality, particularly in the context of foraging ecology. We tested whether individual caribou (Rangifer tarandus) displayed plasticity in movement and space-use behavior across a gradient of resource aggregation. We quantified first-passage time and range-use ratio as proxies for movement-related foraging behavior and examined how these traits varied at the individual level across a foraging resource gradient. Our results suggest that individuals adjusted first-passage time but not range-use ratio to maximize access to high-quality foraging resources. First-passage time was repeatable, and intercepts for first-passage time and range-use ratio were negatively correlated. Individuals matched first-passage time but not range-use ratio to the expectations of our patch-use model that maximized access to foraging resources, a result that suggests that individuals acclimated their movement patterns to accommodate both intra- and interannual variation in foraging resources on the landscape. Collectively, we highlight repeatable movement and space-use tactics and provide insight into how individual plasticity in movement interacts with landscape processes to affect the distribution of behavioral phenotypes and potentially fitness and population dynamics.",4361,THE TIME-SCALE PROBLEM IN EXPLOITER-VICTIM MODELS - DOES THE SOLUTION LIE IN RATIO-DEPENDENT EXPLOITATION,"Standard exploiter-victim models assume an instantaneous connection between foraging and population dynamics. However, in nature this connection is inevitably time-delayed: it takes time to convert food into offspring. R. Arditi and L. R. Ginzburg proposed that this time delay implies ratio-dependent exploitation. Models with ratio-dependent exploitation predict that primary productivity has no impact on food chain length and that the standing crop of all trophic levels increases linearly with increasing primary productivity. Conversely, the traditional victim-dependent models imply that food chain length increases with increasing primary productivity and that only top trophic levels and trophic levels that are an even number of links below the top respond positively to increasing primary productivity. We study the impact of time-delayed numerical responses on predator isoclines, and we do not find support of the theoretical arguments of Arditi and Ginzburg. We also review data on biomass patterns in plants and herbivores, which seem to support the predictions of the victim-dependent model."
2,3,Floral Trait Evolution of Angiosperms on Pacific Islands,"Animals frequently evolve unique suites of traits on islands, but whether plants evolve comparable island syndromes remains unresolved. Here, we test the prediction on the basis of natural history observations that insect-pollinated plants evolve smaller flowers on islands than on mainland communities. We examined 556 plant species representing 136 phylogenetically independent contrasts between island and mainland sister taxa. We focused on endemic taxa originating from the Americas associated with seven tropical and subtropical islands of the Pacific Ocean. Contrary to conventional wisdom, flowers were not on average smaller on islands than on the mainland. On specific archipelagos (the Galapagos Islands and Revillagigedo Islands), however, island taxa did evolve smaller flowers. Divergence in flower size between island and mainland taxa also varied among taxonomic families, such that some plant families evolved smaller flowers on islands, other families evolved larger flowers on islands, and some families exhibited no divergence in flower size between island and mainland taxa. Overall, our results show that there is no general island syndrome for flower size, but instead that the evolution of floral morphology is complex and context dependent, depending on variation among islands and plant families. Our results also suggest that if island floras are typically dominated by small flowered species, as suggested by natural history observations, then ecological filtering is a more likely explanation of this pattern than evolutionary divergence postcolonization. We propose future studies that could disentangle the relative roles of ecological filtering and evolution in the distribution of floral traits on islands.",8008,AN ANALYTICAL STUDY OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF RANA-SEPTENTRIONALIS,"Where moisture is a limiting factor, xerophytic plant communities possess fewer species than do the communities of mesophytic regions, but the number of communities per unit of area is likely to be larger than in regions of adequate moisture. This promotes geographic separation of species populations and races, and thus might be expected to speed up evolution. Evidence that certain mesophytic types are derived from xerophytic ancestors is presented for the genera Scorzonera and Tragopogon of the Compositae, tribe Cichorieae, and for certain genera of the subfamilies Mimosoideae and Caesalpinoideae of the family Leguminosae. The evidence in the latter family is derived chiefly from the development of both adult and seedling leaves."
3,4,Looking for Mimicry in a Snake Assemblage Using Deep Learning,"Batesian mimicry is a canonical example of evolution by natural selection, popularized by highly colorful species resembling unrelated models with astonishing precision. However, Batesian mimicry could also occur in inconspicuous species and rely on subtle resemblance. Although potentially widespread, such instances have been rarely investigated, such that the real frequency of Batesian mimicry has remained largely unknown. To fill this gap, we developed a new approach using deep learning to quantify the visual resemblance between putative mimics and models from photographs. We applied this method to Western Palearctic snakes. Potential nonvenomous mimics were revealed by an excess of resemblance to sympatric venomous snakes compared with random expectations. We found that 8% of the nonvenomous species were potential mimics, although they resembled their models imperfectly. This study is the first to quantify the frequency of Batesian mimicry in a whole community of vertebrates, and it shows that even concealed species can act as potential models. Our approach should prove useful for detecting mimicry in other communities, and more generally it highlights the benefits of deep learning for quantitative studies of phenotypic resemblance.",2234,Predator-dependent species-area relationships,"In addition to having a positive effect on species richness (species-area relationships [SARs]), habitat area can influence the presence of predators, which can indirectly influence prey richness. While these direct and indirect effects of area on richness occur simultaneously, no research has examined how predation might contribute to SAR variation. We extend MacArthur and Wilson's equilibrium theory of island biogeography by including predation-induced shifts in prey extinction and predict that predators will reduce slopes of prey SARs. We provide support for this with data from two insular ecosystems: orthopteran richness in Ozark glades ( rocky herbaceous communities within a forested matrix) with and without insectivorous lizards and zooplankton richness in freshwater ponds with and without zooplanktivorous fishes. Our results emphasize that anthropogenic activities yield simultaneous changes in processes altering diversity and that it is critical that we understand how these components of anthropogenic change interact to impact diversity."
4,5,Correlated Evolution of Sex Allocation and Mating System in Wrasses and Parrotfishes,"In accordance with predictions of the size-advantage model, comparative evidence confirms that protogynous sex change is lost when mating behavior is characterized by weak size advantage. However, we lack comparative evidence supporting the adaptive significance of sex change. Specifically, it remains unclear whether increasing male size advantage induces transitions to protogynous sex change across species, as it can within species. We show that in wrasses and parrotfishes (Labridae) the evolution of protogynous sex change is correlated with polygynous mating and that the degree of male size advantage expressed by polygynous species influences transitions between different types of protogynous sex change. Phylogenetic reconstructions reveal strikingly similar patterns of sex allocation and mating system evolution with comparable lability. Despite the plasticity of sex-determination mechanisms in labrids, transitions trend toward monandry (all males derived from sex-changed females), with all observed losses of protogyny accounted for by shifts in the timing of sex change to prematuration. Likewise, transitions in mating system trend from the ancestral condition of lek-like polygyny toward greater male size advantage, characteristic of haremic polygyny. The results of our comparative analyses are among the first to confirm the adaptive significance of sex change as described by the size-advantage model.",5736,BALANCED SEX-RATIOS IN DIMORPHIC ALTRICIAL BIRDS - THE CONTRIBUTION OF SEX-SPECIFIC GROWTH DYNAMICS,"Sex ratio theory holds that the population sex ratio at the termination of parental care should reflect expenditures on males and females. Where sexual dimorphism occurs in required expenditure, the sex ratio should be skewed in favor of the less costly sex. Male fledglings of the yellow-headed blackbird weigh about one and one-half times their female contemporaries, leading to a prediction of a strongly female-biased sex ratio. Data from this study and others show that this species appears to have a sex ratio approximating unity. I show differences in the dynamics of growth of males and females such that females fledge at an earlier age, show earlier maturation of plumage, relatively faster attainment of adult measurements, and lower variability of growth parameters than males. The effect is to sharply reduce the disparity in energetic requirements of males and females below that expected on the basis of weight. Other dimorphic species have yielded similar findings with regard to both sex ratios and growth patterns, suggesting that such mechanisms are general in maintaining a sex ratio of unity in dimorphic species."
5,6,Climate Change and Thermoregulatory Consequences of Activity Time in Mammals,"Activity times structure the thermal environments experienced by organisms. In mammals, species shift from being nocturnal to diurnal and vice versa, but the thermal consequences of variable activity patterns remain largely unexplored. Here we used theoretical thermoregulatory polygons bounded by estimates of basal metabolic rates (BMR), maximum metabolic rates (MMR), and thermal conductance (C) in small mammals to explore the metabolic consequences of exposure to global-scale daytime and nighttime temperatures. Model predictions indicated higher metabolic scope for activity for nocturnal species at low latitudes and that reduced minimumCand larger body size increased the geographic range in which nocturnality was advantageous. Consistent with predictions, within rodents nocturnal species have lowC. However, nocturnal mammals tend to be smaller than diurnal species, likely reflecting the importance of additional factors driving body size. Projections of warming impacts on small mammals suggest that diurnal species could lose habitable space globally. Conversely, warming could lift cool temperature constraints on nocturnal species and increase habitable space, suggesting that a shift toward nocturnal niches might be favored in a warming world. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of energetic considerations for endotherms in managing global change impacts on nocturnal and diurnal species.",6190,GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF THERMAL EQUILIBRIA - A CONCEPTUAL-MODEL FOR EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF NATURAL AND MODIFIED THERMAL REGIMES ON AQUATIC INSECT COMMUNITIES,"Adult body size and fecundity of several species of hemimetabolous aquatic insects were shown to depend largely on thermal conditions during larval growth. We suggest that an ""optimum"" thermal regime exists where adult size and fecundity are maximized; temperature regimes warmer or cooler than the ""optimum'' result in small and less fecund adults. Two hypotheses concerning river water temperatures and size variation of adult insects are described. First, maximum adult size reflects an equilibrium between several developmental processes that appear highly temperature dependent, viz., (i) the rate and duration of larval growth, and (ii) the specific time in larval development that adult structures begin maturing and the rate of this maturation process. Second, a species distribution both locally within drainage systems and over a large geographic area is limited, in part, by lowered fecundity as adult size gradually diminishes in streams of increasingly cold or warm temperature cycles. The importance of river water temperatures to insect community development is discussed."
6,7,Optimal Network Architectures for Spatially Structured Populations with Heterogeneous Diffusion,"The motivation of this article is to derive new management guidelines to maximize the overall population size using popular management and conservation strategies, such as protected marine areas and ecological corridors. These guidelines are based on the identification of the network architectures for which the total population size is maximized. Describing the biological roles of the typical network variables in the fate of the population is a classic problem with many practical applications. This article suggests that the optimal network architecture relies heavily on the degree of mobility of the population. The recommended network architecture for populations with reduced mobility (in the absence of cost of dispersal and landscapes made up of many sources) is a graph with a patch that has routes toward any other patch with a lower growth rate. However, for highly mobile populations there are many possible network architectures for which the total population size is maximized (e.g., any cyclic graph). We have paid special attention to species with symmetric movement in heterogeneous landscapes. A striking result is that the network architecture does not have any influence on the total population size for highly mobile populations when any pair of different patches can be connected by a sequence of paths.",1256,Beyond the Competition-Colonization Trade-Off: Linking Multiple Trait Response to Disturbance Characteristics,"Disturbances' role in shaping communities is well documented but highly disputed. We suggest replacing the overused two-trait trade-off approach with a functional group scheme, constructed from combinations of four key traits that represent four classes of species' responses to disturbances. Using model results and field observations from sites affected by two highly different disturbances, we demonstrated that popular dichotomous trade-offs are not sufficient to explain community dynamics, even if some emerge under certain conditions. Without disturbances, competition was only sufficient to predict species survival but not relative success, which required some escape mechanism (e.g., long-term dormancy). With highly predictable and large-scale disturbances, successful species showed a combination of high individual tolerance to disturbance and, more surprisingly, high competitive ability. When disturbances were less predictable, high individual tolerance and long-term seed dormancy were favored, due to higher environmental uncertainty. Our study demonstrates that theories relying on a small number of predefined trade-offs among traits (e.g., competition-colonization trade-off) may lead to unrealistic results. We suggest that the understanding of disturbance-community relationships can be significantly improved by employing sets of relevant trait assemblies instead of the currently common approach in which trade-offs are assumed in advance."
7,8,Dispersal Predicts Hybrid Zone Widths across Animal Diversity: Implications for Species Borders under Incomplete Reproductive Isolation,"Hybrid zones occur as range boundaries for many animal taxa. One model for how hybrid zones form and stabilize is the tension zone model, a version of which predicts that hybrid zone widths are determined by a balance between random dispersal into hybrid zones and selection against hybrids. Here, we examine whether random dispersal and proxies for selection against hybrids (genetic distances between hybridizing pairs) can explain variation in hybrid zone widths across 131 hybridizing pairs of animals. We show that these factors alone can explain similar to 40% of the variation in zone width among animal hybrid zones, with dispersal explaining far more of the variation than genetic distances. Patterns within clades were idiosyncratic. Genetic distances predicted hybrid zone widths particularly well for reptiles, while this relationship was opposite tension zone predictions in birds. Last, the data suggest that dispersal and molecular divergence set lower bounds on hybrid zone widths in animals, indicating that there are geographic restrictions on hybrid zone formation. Overall, our analyses reinforce the fundamental importance of dispersal in hybrid zone formation and more generally in the ecology of range boundaries.",5690,THE INTRODUCED HAWAIIAN AVIFAUNA - BIOGEOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE FOR COMPETITION,"We discuss the patterns of introduction and extinction of the species of land birds (passeriforms and columbiforms) introduced to the Hawaiian Islands over the last century. The data are consistent with the idea that rising extinction rates will eventually match immigration rates leading to a dynamic equilibrium. Turnover in species composition is a prominent feature of the introduced Hawaiian avifauna with extinctions common even among populations that had persisted for decades. We could not detect an effect of island size on extinction rate. However, the per species extinction rates do increase with the number of species on the island. This suggests that the species mutually affect each other's chances of extinction. Other explanations for an increasing per-species extinction rate do not seem to be consistent with our data. Thus, interspecific competition seems to have been an important process in determining extinction rate and, by extension, the equilibrium number of species on these islands."
8,9,"Where Is Natural History in Ecological, Evolutionary, and Behavioral Science?","Natural history is the careful observation of nature, wherever nature is. Ultimately, it is what ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral science are supposed to explain. It is difficult to use natural history alone to test hypotheses in these fields because of the complex paths between process and pattern. Few patterns are predicted by one and only one hypothesis, so experiments are almost always necessary. However, the robustness of experimental results depends on how well experimental conditions reflect the integration of natural history. Natural history also plays a vital role in how well we can apply Krogh's principle to our work. Krogh's principle is that scientists begin with an important hypothesis and find a system (organism, habitat, species interaction) with which to test it. However, natural history is essential for knowing whether the question applies to the system or whether we are forcing the question on the system. There is value in beginning one's research not by identifying an interesting question and searching for the right system but by identifying an interesting system in which to ask the right question. This approach carries the danger of parochialism, which can be avoided only by having a command of theory as well as natural history. A command of both areas allows nature to tell us which question to ask instead of demanding that nature answer the question we find most interesting.",2149,Predation-competition interactions for seasonally recruiting species,"We investigate the interacting effects of predation and competition on species coexistence in a model of seasonally recruiting species in a constant environment. For these species, life-history parameters, such as maximum productivity and survival, have important roles in fluctuation-dependent species coexistence in that they introduce nonlinearities into population growth rates and cause endogenous population fluctuations, which can activate the coexistence mechanism termed ""relative nonlinearity."" Under this mechanism, different species must differ in the nonlinearities of their growth rates and must make different contributions to fluctuations in competition and predation. Both of these features can result from life-history trade-offs associated with seasonal recruitment. Coexistence by relative nonlinearity can occur with or without predation. However, predation can undermine coexistence. It does this by reducing variance contrasts between species. However, when competition is not sufficient to cause endogenous population fluctuations, predation can enable fluctuation-dependent coexistence by destabilizing the equilibrium. This model also reproduces the classic finding that coexistence can occur with selective predation provided that it causes a trade-off between competition and predation. Our model is formulated for competition between annual plant species subject to seed predation, but it also applies to perennial communities where competition and predation limit recruitment to the adult population."
9,10,Species Differences in Phenology Shape Coexistence,"Ecological theory produces opposing predictions about whether differences in the timing of life-history transitions, or ""phenology,"" promote or limit coexistence. Phenological separation is predicted to create temporal niche differences, increasing coexistence, yet phenological separation could also competitively favor one species, increasing fitness differences and hindering coexistence. We experimentally manipulated relative germination timing, a critical phenological event, of two annual grass species, Vulpia microstachys and V. octoflora, to test these contrasting predictions. We parameterized a competition model to estimate within-season niche differences, fitness differences, and coexistence and to estimate coexistence when year-to-year fluctuations of germination timing occur. Increasing germination separation caused parallel changes in niche and fitness differences, with the net effect of weakening within-year coexistence. Both species experienced a competitive advantage by germinating earlier, and a 4-day head start allowed the generally inferior competitor to exclude the otherwise superior competitor. The overall consequence of germination separation was to limit coexistence within a given year, although year-to-year variation in the relative timing of germination was sufficient to support long-term coexistence. Our results clarify how phenological differences structure competitive interactions and highlight the need to quantify year-to-year variation in these differences to better understand species coexistence.",1360,Successional Dynamics in the Seasonally Forced Diamond Food Web,"Plankton seasonal succession is a classic example of non-equilibrium community dynamics. Despite the fact that it has been well studied empirically, it lacks a general quantitative theory. Here we investigate a food web model that includes a resource, two phytoplankton, and a shared grazer-the diamond food web-in a seasonal environment. The model produces a number of successional trajectories that have been widely discussed in the context of the verbal Plankton Ecology Group model of succession, such as a spring bloom of a good competitor followed by a grazer-induced clear-water phase, setting the stage for the late-season dominance of a grazer-resistant species. It also predicts a novel, counterintuitive trajectory where the grazer-resistant species has both early- and late-season blooms. The model often generates regular annual cycles but sometimes produces multiyear cycles or chaos, even with identical forcing each year. Parameterizing the model, we show how the successional trajectory depends on nutrient supply and the length of the growing season, two key parameters that vary among water bodies. This model extends nonequilibrium theory to food webs and is a first step toward a quantitative theory of plankton seasonal succession."
